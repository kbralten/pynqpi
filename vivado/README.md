# Vivado Source Directory

## Overview
This directory (`vivado/`) contains the **version-controlled source artifacts** for the PYNQ-Pi project. Unlike the `vivado_work/` directory, which is ephemeral and machine-specific, this folder contains the necessary scripts and source files to recreate the project on any machine.

## Directory Structure

*   **`src/`**: Contains the primary user source files.
    *   `rtl/`: Verilog/VHDL source files (Top-level wrappers, custom modules).
    *   `constraints/`: XDC constraint files.
    *   `sim/`: Simulation testbenches and sources.

*   **`bd/`**: Block Design Tcl scripts (`.tcl`).
    *   Contains the exported Tcl representation of Vivado Block Designs (e.g., `system_design.tcl`).
    *   These scripts are used to recreate the block diagrams exactly as they were designed.

*   **`ip/`**: Standalone IP configurations.
    *   Contains Tcl scripts for any IP cores that are NOT part of a block design (standalone instances).

*   **`scripts/`**: Helper configuration scripts generated by the export process.
    *   `ip_repos.tcl`: Contains the paths to external IP repositories (e.g., `vivado-library`).
    *   `project_info.tcl`: Stores project metadata like the Target Part and Board Part.

## Usage
These files are generated by running the `export.tcl` script in `../vivado_work/`.
Do not edit these generated Tcl files manually unless you know what you are doing. Instead, modify the project in Vivado and re-run the export script.
## Reconstructing the Project
To recreate the Vivado project from these sources, run the import script from the `vivado_work/` directory:

```bash
cd vivado_work
vivado -source import.tcl
```

This script utilizes the Tcl files in the `vivado/` directory to reconstruct the block designs, IP configurations, and project settings.
